This project analyzes wine reviews from Wine Enthusiast to solve four key tasks using pre-processed datasets: identifying the best vineyard, recommending top three wines, ranking important features for wine ratings, and identifying the most common "dry" and "citrus" varieties. Each problem is addressed with a dedicated dataset copy, focusing on relevant variables and efficient preprocessing. Solutions involve handling categorical and numerical data through techniques such as label encoding and random forest feature importance, while ensuring meaningful filtering and ranking. Tools like Python, pandas, and Scikit-learn were used alongside data visualization libraries for analysis and reporting. The project highlights robust data handling, efficient variable selection, and insightful recommendations based on domain-specific criteria.

This submission, along with an oral presentation of my analysis at the assessment center (see the PDF file in the repo), landed me a highly competitive data science internship at the UK's Financial Conduct Authority.
